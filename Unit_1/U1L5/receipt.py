"""Your task for the assigngment is as follows:
     1. Create a variable and store the response 
        to the user's total for their bill
     2. Create a variable and store the response 
        to the user's tip amount
     3. Display a receipt that show the total, tip, 
        tax, and grand total, as well as if the the tip 
        was over 15% The output should look like this:
           a. remember % go to decimals by moving 2 places
              so 15% is .15
           b. tax is 5.5% so .055
           c. do not worry about extra decimals as you see in
              this example under tax 
           d. remember for the tests, spacing matters, but you
              can still score perfect if they fail as long as
              spacing is the only issue: Meaning --
                   Sub Total: $ 10.23 would mark correct, but
                   Sub Total:$10.23 would be marked wrong
        
        =====================
        Sub Total: $ 10.23
        Tip Amt: $ 2.00
        Over 15%:  True
        Tax: $ 0.56265
        ----------------------
        Grand Total: $ 12.79265 """
